# Hey there, I'm Esmira 👋

Hey! I'm Esmira — a passionate front-end learner, aspiring developer, and creative soul from Georgia 🇬🇪  
I’m currently on a **glow-up journey** in both coding and life ✨  
Right now, I’m focused on mastering **JavaScript, React**, and crafting clean, beautiful designs with **Figma**.  

🎯 My biggest goals:
- Become disciplined & consistent with my learning  
- Build meaningful projects that challenge me  
- Grow into a developer who creates things that *inspire others*

Outside of code, I love music (K-pop stan 💜), design, and exploring mindset & personal growth.  
This is just the beginning — I’m building my dream life one commit at a time 💻🌱
